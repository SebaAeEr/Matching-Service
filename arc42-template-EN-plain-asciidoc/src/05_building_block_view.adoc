Cpee Engine::
is the orchestrator of the matching service. It receives and saves the rules and messages from the Correlator, calls the different matching methods, manages the matching results and sends them back to the Correlator.

Matching Server::
is a Python server responsible for implementing and initiating matching instances with different matching methods.

Correlator::
receives rules and listens to messages from a messaging service. Whenever new data comes in it sends them to the Matcher Service and returns the matching results back to their individual callbacks.

Important Interfaces::
*run matching* +
This interface enables the Cpee engine to specify the matching method and to send all the needed data to the Matcher.

=== Level 2

The following figure shows the internal structure of the Matching Server and the Cpee Engine.

Listener Rules::
manages asnycronous connection with Correlator and saves new rules to the temporary storage of the Cpee Engine.

Listener Messages::
manages asnycronous connection with Correlator and saves new messages to the temporary storage of the Cpee Engine.

Matching::
is the core piece of the Cpee Engine. When changes in the data are recogniced the Matching Server will be called, the matching results will be combined and send to the Correlator and lastly rules and messages in the matching results will be deleted from the temporary storage.

Uvicorn Server::
offers the interface for the Cpee Engine to send the needed data to start a Matcher.

Matcher::
matches the rules and the messages with the given method and returns the result back to the Cpee Engine.
