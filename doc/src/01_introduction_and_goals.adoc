== Introduction and Goals
This document describes the Matching Service, which is used by correlators to match rules with messages. In order to also match faulty messages (e.g. Voice-Messages which are transcribed) with the best rule, this service offers multiple matching methods like phonetic, lexicographic or ML algorithms using openai. For each correlator a new instance of this service should be easily initialized, configured and even upgraded to match the different use cases of the correlator.
// as it is implemented service-oriented architecture implemented with Cpee this service is easily upgradeable with more functionality and configurable even by untrained users in order to meet different use cases.


=== Requirements Overview

|===
|Functional Requirement|Explanation
| Matching |
| Data retrieval | Creating connections with the correlator in order to retrieve new messages and rules.
| Data deletion | Deletion of already matched messages or rules.
| Data storing | 
| Sending back matching results | 
| Combining matching-results | Combining the matching results of multiple methods and deleting duplicate matches to the same rule.

|Quality Goal|Explanation
| Configurability | Ease of configurability of the service by the user for different correlators and use cases.
| Upgradeability | Ease of upgradeability of the service to add more functionality like new matching methods or more complex deletion schemes.
| Performance | The service should return results in a reasonable time (max. few seconds) as soon as new data comes in.
| Transparency | Ease of understanding, seeing and testing the service and it's underlying data flows.
