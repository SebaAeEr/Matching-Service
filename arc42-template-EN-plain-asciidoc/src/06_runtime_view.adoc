=== Example: A new rule gets inserted


* The service call which established the asyncronous connection with the Correlator receives a new rule and pushes it to the back of the rule list in the local storage of the Cpee engine.
* The matcher thread recognises that the length of the rule list changed and starts the matching process:
. It freezes the current rule and message list in a new variable
. It calls the matching server with the frozen data to start a matching with the phonetical method.
. It calls the matching server with the frozen data to start a matching with the lexicographical method.
. If there are matching results, they get cleaned up by deleting duplicate matches on the same rule.
. The callback-url of the rule and the message-body of the message for each match are send as tuples to the correlator.
. Rules and messages found in the matching result get deleted from the rule and message list.
. The new length of the rule and message list are calculated to recognise new changes to the lists.
