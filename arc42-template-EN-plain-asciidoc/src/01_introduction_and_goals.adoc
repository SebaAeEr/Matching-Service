== Introduction and Goals
This document describes the Matching Service, which is used by correlators to match rules with messages. Especially as messages can be faulty (e.g. Voice-Messages which are transcribed), this service offers multiple matching methods like phonetic, lexicographic or ML algorithms using openai. For each correlator an new instance of this service should be easily initialised, configured and even upgraded to match the different use cases of the correlator.
// as it is implemented service-oriented architecture implemented with Cpee this service is easily upgradeable with more functionality and configurable even by untrained users in order to meet different use cases.


=== Requirements Overview
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Functional Requirement|Explanation
| Matching | Matching the rules and messages with different methods, as soon as new data comes in.
| Data retrieval | Creating two asynchronous connections with the correlator in order to retrieve new messages and rules.
| Data deletion | Deletion of already matched messages or rules. Can be upgraded with more variation on how to handle different rules.
| Data storing | Storing the data in temporary storage.
| Sending back matching results | Sending the correlator the matching results, which are tuples of the callback-url and the message.
| Combining matching-results | Combining the matching results of multiple methods and deleting duplicate matches to the same rule.

=== Quality Goal

|===
|Quality Goal|Explanation
| Configurability | Ease of configurability of the service by the user for different correlators and use cases.
| Upgradeability | Ease of upgradeability of the service to add more functionality like new matching methods or more complex deletion schemes.
| Performance | The service should return results in reasonable time (max. few seconds) as soon as new data comes in.
| Transparency | Ease of understanding, seeing and testing the service and it's underlying data flows.
